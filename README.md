Boston Housing Price Prediction
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict housing prices in Boston using various features from the Boston Housing dataset. The goal is to create a robust regression model that can accurately estimate the median value of owner-occupied homes based on various factors.
Project Overview
This project tackles a supervised learning regression problem. The model was developed using Python and leverages several key machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn and Pandas. The primary steps involved include data preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and saving the model for future use.
Features
•	Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and stratified sampling to ensure robust model performance.
•	Modeling: Implementation of various regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
•	Evaluation: Model evaluation through cross-validation, with metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to measure performance.
•	Deployment: The final model is saved using Joblib for future predictions.

Environment
•	Programming Language: Python
•	Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Joblib
•	Tools: Google Colab
